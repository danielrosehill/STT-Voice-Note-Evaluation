An example of a voice note I'm taking deliberately. I'm trying my best to soothe my lovely son, but as probably can be heard in the background quite clearly, I hope, he is crying. And for parents who are working from home and trying to get things done, and maybe taking voice notes, I'm adding this to my training set because this would be a particularly common type of auditory background noise.  
  
As you can hear, he's crying pretty vigorously, and I'm trying to do my best to both keep him holding the pacifier in his mouth with one hand, and I'm speaking to my live mic in the other. But it's probably very hard to distinguish between me and the noise, so it'd be interesting to see if there's any background noise in the filter that can actually, A, scrub this audio, and B, do the text-to-speech despite the very, very loud.  
  
This is about as loud as you get. We're at 46 weeks, that kind of hard point in the journey. So anyway, this will be my... I don't think I'll do a sample set of this. This one will have to suffice. But this is the sound of trying to voice note with a screaming child.
