Okay, so things I need to get done today. First thing is I need to check on that GitHub Actions workflow that's been failing. It's something with the Docker build, I think the base image changed or something. Should be a quick fix but I keep forgetting to look at it. Second thing, I promised Sarah I'd set up that home automation thing for the lights in the nursery. It's just a simple Zigbee bulb but I need to pair it with Home Assistant and create some automations. Shouldn't take long but you know how these things go, always some weird edge case. Oh, and I need to follow up on that email from the pediatrician's office about Dov's appointment next week. They want to reschedule or something. I should probably call them instead of playing email tag. Let me see, what else. I want to experiment with that new Whisper model that OpenAI released. Apparently it's much faster for real-time transcription which could be useful for my voice notes workflow. And I should really update my blog, I haven't posted anything in like two weeks. Maybe I'll write something about the challenges of working from home with a newborn. People seem to relate to that kind of content.
