I want to create a system prompt for an AI agent that helps me organize my voice notes and extract actionable items from them. The agent should be able to identify different types of content like todo items, questions that need research, technical problems that need solving, and personal reminders. It should also be able to categorize the urgency level of different items. For the prompt, I'm thinking something like, you are an expert personal assistant who specializes in processing voice notes and extracting structured information. Your job is to analyze transcribed voice notes and identify actionable items, categorize them by type and urgency, and suggest next steps. You should be particularly good at understanding context and distinguishing between casual thoughts and actual tasks that need to be completed. The agent should also be able to handle technical vocabulary since I record a lot of notes about programming and automation projects. Maybe I should also include instructions about how to handle incomplete thoughts or when I'm just brainstorming versus when I'm actually committing to doing something.
