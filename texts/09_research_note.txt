I've been reading about speech-to-text accuracy for different accents and I'm wondering if my Israeli English accent affects the transcription quality. I've noticed that sometimes the Voice Notes app gets confused with certain words, especially when I'm tired and my accent gets stronger. It's interesting because Whisper is supposed to be pretty good with accents but I think there might be some edge cases. I should probably do some testing, maybe record the same sentence with different levels of accent and see how the transcription varies. This could actually be useful for my STT evaluation project. I'm thinking I could create a dataset of voice notes with varying accent strengths and use that to benchmark different speech-to-text services. Deepgram, OpenAI Whisper, Google Speech-to-Text, maybe Azure too. The challenge would be quantifying accent strength in a consistent way. Maybe I could get native English speakers to rate the accent level on a scale. Or I could use some kind of phonetic analysis tool. This could be a really interesting project, especially since there's not a lot of research on Hebrew-English bilingual speech patterns in STT systems.
