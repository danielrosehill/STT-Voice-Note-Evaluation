So I'm thinking about this new project I want to work on. It's basically going to be a voice notes app but specifically for, um, for capturing ideas when I'm walking around or when I'm with the baby and I can't type. The thing is, I already have Voice Notes which works really well, but I'm thinking maybe I should build my own because then I can integrate it directly with my N8N workflows without having to rely on their webhook system. I mean, their webhook system is fine, but you know how it is with third-party dependencies. The architecture would be pretty simple, I think. Just an Android app that records audio, sends it to Whisper or maybe Deepgram for transcription, and then posts the result to my own webhook endpoint. I could probably build this in a weekend if I use something like React Native or maybe just go native Android since I only need it for myself. The tricky part might be getting the audio quality right and handling network issues when I'm out and about. Oh, and I should probably add some kind of local storage so if the upload fails it can retry later. Actually, let me think about this more. Do I really need another app or should I just improve my current workflow?
