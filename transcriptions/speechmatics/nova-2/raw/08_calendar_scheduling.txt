I need to schedule several appointments for next week. Let me go through these one by one. First schedule Dov's pediatrician appointment for Tuesday, November the 14th at 10:30 a.m. at the clinic on Herzl Street. Duration should be about 45 minutes. For the one month checkup. Make sure to add a reminder 30 minutes before to prepare my questions list. Second, I need to book a dentist appointment for myself. I've been putting this off for months. Schedule it for Wednesday, November the 15th at 2 p.m. at Doctor Cohen's office at Ben-Yehuda Street. It should take about an hour for regular cleaning. Third, schedule a video call with the client about the automation project for Thursday, November the 16th at 11 a.m.. Block out 90 minutes for this since we'll probably need to go through technical details. Add the zoom link to the calendar entry. Fourth, Sara needs her postpartum checkup scheduled for Friday, November the 17th at 9 a.m. at the Women's Health Clinic. That's usually a 30 minute appointment. And finally, schedule a grocery pickup for Sunday, November the 19th at 4 p.m. at the shufersal on Rephaim, which should take about 15 minutes to collect the order.
