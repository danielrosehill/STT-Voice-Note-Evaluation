So, Dov has been doing this thing where he gets really fussy in the evenings, like around 6 or 7 p.m., and nothing seems to calm him down. We've tried feeding, changing his diaper, swaddling, the white noise machine, everything. Sarah thinks it might be colic, but I'm not sure. He's fine during the day, sleeps well, eats well, but then evening comes and it's like a switch flips. I've been reading about the witching hour; apparently it's pretty common with newborns, but I want to make sure we're not missing something. Should we be concerned? Is there anything specific we should try? I'm thinking maybe it's overstimulation from the day or maybe he's just tired but fighting sleep. We have his one-month checkup next week, so I'll definitely bring it up with the pediatrician, but in the meantime, I'd love to have some strategies to try. The crying is pretty intense and it's hard on both of us, especially Sarah since she's still recovering. Oh, and another thing, he seems to prefer being held upright rather than lying down when he's fussy. Does that mean anything?
