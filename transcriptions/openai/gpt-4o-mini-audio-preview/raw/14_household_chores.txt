Here's the transcription of the audio:

"Okay, so I need to get organized with the household stuff this week. First thing, I really need to do laundry. We're running out of clean clothes and go through so many outfits every day with all the spit-ups and diaper leaks. I should probably do a load of baby clothes separately with that gentle detergent Sarah bought. Second, the kitchen needs a deep clean. The dishes have been piling up and I haven't properly cleaned the counters in a few days. With a newborn in the house, I want to make sure everything stays sanitary. Third, I should vacuum the living room and bedroom. There's a lot of dust accumulating and Sarah's been sneezing more lately. Maybe it's affecting her recovery. Fourth, I need to take out the trash and recycling. The diaper disposal is getting full and it's starting to smell. Fifth, I should organize the baby's room a bit better. All the gifts and baby supplies are just scattered around and it's hard to find things when we need them in the middle of the night. Maybe I can set up some kind of system for organizing diapers, clothes by size, and all the feeding supplies."
