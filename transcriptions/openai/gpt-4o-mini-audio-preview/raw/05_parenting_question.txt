It sounds like you're dealing with a challenging situation. Based on the transcription, here are a few points to consider:

1. **Evening Fussiness**: This is often referred to as the "witching hour" and is common in newborns. It can be a time when babies are more fussy and difficult to soothe.

2. **Possible Colic**: Colic is characterized by intense crying and fussiness, often in the evenings. It's good to discuss this with your pediatrician to rule out any underlying issues.

3. **Overstimulation or Tiredness**: Newborns can become overstimulated during the day, leading to fussiness in the evening. Ensuring a calm and quiet environment might help.

4. **Upright Position Preference**: Some babies prefer being held upright, which can help with gas or reflux. This might indicate that your baby feels more comfortable in an upright position.

5. **Consulting the Pediatrician**: It's important to discuss these observations and concerns during the one-month checkup to get professional advice and support.

In the meantime, you might try gentle rocking, swaddling, or using a baby carrier to keep your baby close and upright. Each baby is different, so finding what soothes your baby best may take some time and patience.
