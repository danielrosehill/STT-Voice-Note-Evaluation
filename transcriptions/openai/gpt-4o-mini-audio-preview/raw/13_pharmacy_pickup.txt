I need to go to the pharmacy tomorrow and pick up a few things. First, I need to get my prescription refilled, the one for the ADHD medication. I think I've one refill left, but I should double-check with the pharmacist. Also, Sarah asked me to pick up some vitamins for after the pregnancy. I think she said folic acid and maybe some iron supplement. The doctor recommended them at her last checkup. Oh, and we're running low on baby supplies, so I should get some diaper rash cream and maybe some of those saline drops for Dove's nose. The pediatrician said they're good to have on hand for when babies get congested. I should also check if they have a good thermometer for infants; the one we have seems a bit unreliable. And while I'm there, I might as well pick up some basic stuff like band-aids and antiseptic cream. We used up most of our first aid supplies when Dove was born, and we had all those visitors. The pharmacy usually has good prices on that kind of stuff compared to the supermarket.
