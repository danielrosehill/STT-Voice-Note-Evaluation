Here's your task in this code repository. Follow these instructions exactly. First go through all my GitHub repositories and identify which ones haven't been updated in over six months. For those repositories check if they have proper readme files and if the documentation is up to date. If not either update the documentation or archive the repository if it's no longer relevant. Second I want the agent to standardize the folder structure across all my active projects. Create a consistent pattern for things like documentation, scripts and configuration files. Third set up an automated deployment pipeline for the repositories that don't have them yet.
