I'm having this weird issue with my Home Assistant setup. The ZigBee integration keeps dropping devices, specifically the motion sensors in the nursery. It's really annoying because I have automations that depend on those sensors to turn on the night light when we go in to check on Dove. The strange thing is it only happens at night. During the day everything works fine. I'm wondering if it's interference from something, maybe the baby monitor or the white noise machine. I've tried moving the ZigBee coordinator closer to the sensors but that didn't help. The logs in Home Assistant aren't super helpful just as the device is unavailable and then it comes back online after a few minutes. I'm thinking maybe I need to add a ZigBee repeater or switch to a different coordinator. The current one is just a basic USB stick. Maybe I should upgrade to something more robust. Oh and I should probably check if there are firmware updates for the sensors. I know Acquire releases updates pretty regularly. This is the kind of thing that works perfectly when you're testing it but fails when you actually need it to work.
