I need to schedule several appointments for next week. Let me go through these one by one. First, schedule Dov's paediatrician appointment for Tuesday, November 14th at 10.30am at the Maccabi Clinic on Hertzell Street. Duration should be about 45 minutes for the one month check-up. Make sure to add a reminder 30 minutes before to prepare my questions list. Second, I need to book a dentist appointment for myself. I've been putting this off for months. Schedule it for Wednesday, November 15th at 2pm at Dr. Cohen's office at Benyahooda Street. Should take about an hour for regular cleaning. Third, schedule a video call with the client about the automation project for Thursday, November 16th at 11am. Block out 90 minutes for this since we'll probably need to go through technical details. Add the Zoom link to the calendar entry. Fourth, Sarah needs her postpartum check-up scheduled for Friday, November 17th at 9am at the Women's Health Clinic. That's usually a 30 minute appointment. And finally, schedule a grocery pick-up for Sunday, November 19th at 4pm at the Schufer Cell on Emich Rafaim. Should take about 15 minutes to collect the order.
