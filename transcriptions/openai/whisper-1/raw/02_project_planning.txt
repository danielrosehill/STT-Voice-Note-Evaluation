so I'm thinking about this new project I want to work on it's basically going to be a voice notes app with specifically for for capturing ideas where I'm walking around or when I was the baby and I can't type the thing is I already have voice notes which works really well I'm thinking maybe I should build my own because then I can integrate it directly with my and a and workflows without having to rely on their webhook system I mean their webhook system is fine but you know it's just it is with third-party dependencies the architecture would be pretty simple I think just an Android app that records audio sends it to whisper or maybe deep gram for transcription and then post the results to my own webhook endpoint I could probably build this in a weekend if I use something like react native or maybe just go native Android since I only need it for myself the tricky part might be getting the audio quality right and handling networking issues when I'm out and about oh and I should probably add some kind of local storage so if the upload fails it can retry later actually let me think about this more do I really need another app or should I just improve my current workflow
