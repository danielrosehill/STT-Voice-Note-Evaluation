I need to make a grocery run later today. Let me think through what we need. First, we're almost out of milk and Sarah's been drinking a lot of it since she's breastfeeding. I should get the whole milk, not the low-fat stuff. We also need bread, maybe get two loaves since we go through it pretty quickly now. For dinner this week, I'm thinking maybe some chicken breast and vegetables. Sarah's been craving healthy meals and I want to make sure she's getting good nutrition. Maybe some broccoli, carrots, and sweet potatoes. Oh, and we definitely need more coffee. We're both running very little sleep and coffee is basically keeping us functional. I should get the good stuff, not the cheap rant. For snacks, maybe some yogurt and fruit. Bananas are always good and they're easy to eat when you're holding a baby. We're also running low on cleaning supplies, so I should grab some dish soap and maybe some disinfectant wipes. With all the visitors coming to see Dove, I want to make sure we can keep things clean. And I should check if they have any easy meal options like pre-made salads or something we can eat up quickly when we don't have time to cook.
