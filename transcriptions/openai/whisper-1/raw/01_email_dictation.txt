So I need to send an email to Sarah about the meeting we had yesterday. Let me just dictate this quickly. Hi Sarah, I wanted to follow up on our conversation from yesterday about the budget review. I've been looking at those numbers you sent over and I think we really need to have another discussion about the API costs. The GPT-4 calls are getting expensive, like really expensive, and I'm wondering if we should look into maybe self hosting something or using a cheaper model. I know we talked about this briefly but I think it deserves more attention. Are you free Tuesday afternoon? Maybe you're in three? I can show you the cost breakdown I've been working on. Let me know what works for you. Thanks Mike. Actually let me add something about the Docker stuff too since we talked about that. The containerization is going well but the images are getting pretty large and I think that's contributing to some of the deployment slowness we've been seeing.
