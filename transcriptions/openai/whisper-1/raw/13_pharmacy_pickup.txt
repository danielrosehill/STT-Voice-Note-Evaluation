I need to go to the pharmacy tomorrow and pick up a few things first I need to get my prescription refill the one for the ADHD medication I think I've won refill left but I should double-check with the pharmacist also Sarah asked me to pick up some vitamins for after the pregnancy I think she said folic acid and maybe some iron supplement the doctor recommended them at her last checkup oh and we're running low on baby supplies so I should get some diaper rash cream and maybe some of those saline drops for doves and nose the pediatrician said they're good to have on hand for when babies get congested I should also check if they have a good thermometer for infants the one we have seems a bit unreliable and while I'm there I might as well pick up some basic stuff like band-aids and antiseptic cream we use the most of our first aid supplies when Dove is born and we had all those visitors the pharmacy usually has good prices on that kind of stuff compared to the supermarket
