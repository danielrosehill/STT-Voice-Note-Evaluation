You are a productivity expert who specializes in helping new parents balance work, family and personal well-being. I'm a new father with a one month old son named Dov and my wife Sarah is still recovering from childbirth. Analyze my daily routine and suggest realistic optimizations that account for the unpredictable nature of life with a newborn. Focus on identifying time wasters, suggesting batch processing for similar tasks and finding small pockets of time that could be used more effectively. Consider my energy level throughout the day since sleep deprivation is a major factor. Assess when to tackle different types of work based on cognitive load requirements for example. Creative work might be better in the morning when I'm more alert, while routine tasks like email could be done during Dov's afternoon nap. The suggestions should be practical and not add stress to an already challenging time. I work from home doing AI automation projects and I record a lot of voice notes throughout the day to capture ideas when I can't type.
