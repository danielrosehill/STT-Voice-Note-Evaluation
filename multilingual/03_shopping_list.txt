I need to go to the supermarket later and pick up some things. Let me make a quick list. First, we need more chamusim for Dov, the diapers are running low again. Sarah asked me to get some yogurt and maybe some gvina levana for breakfast. Oh, and we're out of lechem, so I should get a fresh loaf from the bakery section. I also want to pick up some yerakot for dinner tonight, maybe some gezer and betsel for a soup. The weather is getting cooler so soup sounds good. I should also check if they have those snacks that Sarah likes, the ones with the chocolate. And we definitely need more coffee, we're going through it so fast with the sleep deprivation from having a newborn. Maybe I'll also get some flowers for Sarah, just to brighten up the house a bit. She's been working so hard taking care of Dov and I want her to know I appreciate it. Let me also check if they have any good fruit, maybe some tapuchim or bananot for healthy snacking.
