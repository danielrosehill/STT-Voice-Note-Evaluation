So I need to pick up my teudat zehut from the misrad hapnim tomorrow. I keep forgetting to do this and Sarah keeps reminding me. The appointment is at 10 AM in the merkaz hair, which should be fine because Dov usually sleeps in the morning. I should probably bring all the paperwork they asked for, you know, the forms and the photos. Oh, and I need to remember to bring cash because I think there's some kind of fee. Actually, let me double-check that. I don't want to get there and realize I need to find an ATM. The whole process should be pretty quick, they said maybe 30 minutes max. After that I can stop by the makolet and pick up some things for Shabbat. Sarah asked me to get challah and maybe some wine. I should also check if they have those diapers that Dov likes, the ones from Huggies. We're running low again. It's crazy how fast babies go through diapers. Anyway, the teudat zehut thing has been on my todo list for like two months now, so it'll be good to finally get it done.
