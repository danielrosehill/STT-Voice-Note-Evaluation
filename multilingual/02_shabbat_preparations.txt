So it's erev Shabbat and I need to get organized. Sarah is resting with Dov so I should handle the preparations. First thing, I need to go to the shuk and get some vegetables for dinner. Maybe some carrots and onions for the chicken soup. Oh, and I should pick up some flowers for the table, Sarah always likes that. The makolet should have everything else I need - challah, wine, maybe some hummus and pita for lunch tomorrow. I'm thinking we'll do a simple Shabbat this week since we're both still adjusting to life with the baby. Just the basic stuff, light the nerot, make kiddush, have a nice meal. Dov is still too young to really participate but it's nice to maintain the routine. I should also check if we have enough diapers for the weekend because everything closes early on Friday and doesn't open until motzei Shabbat. Actually, let me make a quick list: challah, yayin, flowers, vegetables, diapers, maybe some snacks. Oh, and I should call my parents and see if they want to come for lunch tomorrow. They've been wanting to spend more time with Dov and Shabbat lunch is always nice with family.
