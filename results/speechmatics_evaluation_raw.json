Hi Sarah, I wanted to follow up on our conversation from yesterday about the budget review. I've been looking at those numbers you sent over and I think we really need to have another discussion about the API costs. The GPT-4 calls are getting expensive, like really expensive, and I'm wondering if we should look into maybe self-hosting something or using a cheaper model. I know we talked about this briefly but I think it deserves more attention. Are you free Tuesday afternoon? Maybe around 3? I can show you the cost breakdown I've been working on. Let me know what works for you. Thanks, Mike. Actually, let me add something about the Docker stuff too since we talked about that. The containerization is going well but the images are getting pretty large and I think that's contributing to some of the deployment slowness we've been seeing.",

I mean, their webhook system is fine, but you know how it is with third-party dependencies. The architecture would be pretty simple, I think. Just an Android app that records audio, sends it to Whisper or maybe Deepgram for transcription, and then posts the result to my own webhook endpoint. I could probably build this in a weekend if I use something like React Native or maybe just go native Android since I only need it for myself. The tricky part might be getting the audio quality right and handling network issues when I'm out and about.

We also talked about the Docker setup. The current images are getting pretty bloated, like 3 gigs each, which is slowing down deployments. I think we need to do some cleanup, maybe use multi-stage builds or switch to Alpine base images. Action items: I'm going to research the costs of different approaches and put together a comparison.

And while I'm there, I might as well pick up some basic stuff like band-aids and antiseptic cream. We used up most of our first aid supplies when Dov was born and we had all those visitors.
